# Professional README Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)  

## Description

This application uses NPM, Node JS, and JavaScript to create a basic Professional README file for developers. The word "basic" is used because the file is generated by a series of questions in the terminal which doesn't have the ability to incorporate listed items, external links outside of the badge and license type, screenshots, and other rich text elements.  However, once the basic README file is created, the user does have the ability to go back in and modify or append as needed.

## Installation

To install the program, run the following command:

1. Make sure that you have Node JS installed. You can find the latest version of NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Clone the starter code
3. Create a `.gitignore` file. In the file, include the following `node_modules/` & `.DS_Store/` to ensure that your directory isn't tracked and uploaded to GitHub if you publish the code/file later. 
4. Ensure you have a `package.json` file with all the required decencies. If you don't have the file run the integrated terminal and run `npm init`.
5. Open the terminal and ensure you follow the right file path.
6. Run `npm i` 
7. Run `Node index.js`
8. Answer all the questions in the terminal
9. The new README file will be located in this application's `./New-README` folder. This is to ensure that the file isn't confused with this application's README file. ðŸ˜€
10. Open the new README file and add any pictures, additional links, and context you would like to include in your README file. 
11. Move your new README file to your project's correct folder to ensure it's in the correct repo!
