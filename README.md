# Professional README Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)  

## Description

This application uses NPM, Node JS, and JavaScript to create a basic Professional README file for developers. The word "basic" is used because the file is generated by a series of questions in the terminal which doesn't have the ability to incorporate listed items, external links outside of the badge and license type, screenshots, and other rich text elements.  However, once the basic README file is created the user does have the ability to go back in and modify or append as needed.
